# Android: Loving Lean Layouts

Example code and application for Huyen Tue Dao's talk on optimizing Android layouts.

## Application Structure

The launch screen of the application displays a list of examples for each section of the talk.
Each section represents an individual tool or topic for layout optimization.

## Sections (WIP)

1. Hierarchy Viewer: a complex layout containing several examples of `Views` and `ViewGroups` that could be optimized and that help demonstrate the use of the SDK Hierarchy Viewer.
2. Attributes: examples of using attributes/methods to consolidate multiple `Views` into a single `View.`
